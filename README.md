# Introduction
### Why did I choose this personal project for Lambda School?
* Project and outcome:
> My initial aim was to create a simple rolling-ball platform game that would teach me many principles in working with 3D 
> Objects, Components, Physics and JavaScript Frameworks.  My minimum viable product is a 3-D web application using 
> authentication and mongoDB to store the fastest player's time in navigating the sphere from beginning to end.
* Project motivation:
> While the Internet evolves as the de-facto cyberspace, virtual environments increasingly facilitate global business and 
> entertainment.  Metaverses (or virtual worlds) are among the newest developments to emerge as a business beyond mere 
> gaming.  Many researchers and professionals in the field say that metaverses are poised to change the way we do business.
* Impact:
> 3D models can improve User Experience by adding novel interactivity to a website or develop applications for webVR.
> Here is a common Three.js example of mapping and organizing data in a virtual space:
