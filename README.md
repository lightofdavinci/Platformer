# Introduction
### Why did I choose such a personal project as a student of the lambda school ?
* Project and outcome:
> The initial goal was to create a simple rolling ball platformer game that would teach me many of the principles of working with 3D Objects, Components, Physics and JavaScript Frameworks. What I have as a minimum viable product is a three-dimensional web application with authentication and back-end with mongoDB to store the fastest time of players who moved the sphere from point A to point B.
* Project motivation:
> The Internet is evolving to become the de-facto cyberspace or virtual environment facilitating communication,
> business, and entertainment on a global scale. On the other hand, metaverses or virtual worlds are much younger 
> when compared to other Web technologies. Virtual worlds are increasingly seen as more than game and interpreted 
> within a business context rather than entertainment. The view that metaverses will play a significant role in the 
> future is shared by many researchers and professionals in the field.
* Impact:
> 3D models have a potential to improve User Experience in the future. Also, it can be useful to know, 
> if you are planning to add interesting interactivity to a website or develop applications for webVR.
> Here is a common three.js example of mapping and organizing data in a virtual spaces.
